# dots

Configs for stuff and things

## Description

I have a few machines, their configs differ by only a little. I store the
settings of each machine in a hostname-named file in `targets/`. Each set of
dotfiles is under `modules/`.

Additionally a few settings, like the names of font families are repeated many
times throughout multiple different dotfiles. This way I can change the setting
everywhere from just one place.
